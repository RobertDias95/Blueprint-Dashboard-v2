-- fix-170 (On-Hold Phase 2, effect D): suppress actively-held projects from the
-- weekly DA report.
--
-- A project with an ACTIVE hold (project_holds.hold_end IS NULL) is parked — its
-- permits aren't actionable this week, so they shouldn't surface in the DA
-- report's corrections / upcoming-intakes buckets (the report is a weekly
-- actionables list). A closed/past hold does NOT suppress (its days are credited
-- via the turnaround math, not by hiding the row).
--
-- The report has no date-based "overdue" flag of its own — both buckets derive
-- from the `base` CTE, so a single NOT EXISTS gate on an active hold removes
-- held projects from both. Re-emitted from the live def (fix-164) with ONLY the
-- hold gate added. Applied to prod via MCP.
